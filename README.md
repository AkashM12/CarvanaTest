# Carvana Final Interview Assignment

Name: Akash Mahesh

The goal of this assignment was to make a program that runs from the command line, and when given text(s) displays a list of the 100 most common three word sequences in the files.

# Running the Program

This program runs on java, so make sure java is installed on the machine. This program works with Java 8 and newer.
You can check which version of Java you are on using this command:

```cmd
java -version
```

After ensuring the correct version of Java is installed, clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AkashM12/CarvanaTest
```

After cloning the repository, navigate to the folder where the repo was cloned. Compile the java code then run it using the following commands:

```cmd
javac mostCommonSequences.java
java mostCommonSequnnces <filePath here>
```

## Improvements

Currently, the program does not work properly when presented with unicode characters, which is functionality I would love to add given more time.
